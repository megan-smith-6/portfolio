      <p class="milli push-1-2 grey-text">Algonquin College—School Project</p>
      <h2 class="kilo push-0">Goal</h2>
      <p class="milli push grey-text">Create an isometric illustration that depicts a process.</p>
      <p class="milli push grey-text">This piece depicts one of my favourite bands—Twenty One Pilots—going through the cycle of music production. From writing music on the living room floor, producing music in the studio, to then performing on a stage. When I first started sketching, I wasn’t exactly sure how I wanted things to look. I tried many different ways of doing the bases for each stage, and I also thought of connecting the platforms with staircases to show the journey that it takes to get to the concert stage of the process.</p>
      <h2 class="kilo push-0">Sketch Process</h2>
      <img class="img-flex push" src="/images/isometric/sketches.jpg" alt="This is an image of the different sketches that I did trying to figure out how I was going to lay out my idea">
      <p class="milli push grey-text">After some consideration, I decided to go ahead with the floating bases because it best represents the struggle of getting from one stage to another in the music industry.</p>
      <h2 class="kilo push-0">Final Work</h2>
      <img class="img-flex push" src="/images/isometric/final.jpg" alt="This is an image of the final isometric illustration">
      <p class="milli push grey-text">I love the way that this illustration turned out. However, I thought I could take it a bit farther and use the illustrations for something other than just a poster. I decided to make an advertisement video that promotes the tour and buying/selling tickets. This advertisement allows fans to see the process of their favourite band making music one individual step at a time. </p>
      <h2 class="kilo push-0">Final Video</h2>
      <div class="push" style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/396223795?loop=1&color=F8BBC6&title=0&portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>
      <h2 class="kilo push-0">Challenges</h2>
      <p class="milli push grey-text">My biggest challenge was getting everything to fit geometrically into the isometric grid. It was my first time doing an isometric illustration, so I had to get used to making things properly fit the point of view that you see them in.</p>
      <p class="milli push grey-text italic push-0">Disclaimer: The logo that is on the backdrop of the stage was not made by me; it is the official Twenty One Pilots Bandito tour logo.</p>
