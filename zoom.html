      <h2 class="kilo push-0">Goal</h2>
      <p class="milli push grey-text">Take an old project that you’ve done and revamp it using the skills you’ve gained.</p>
      <p class="milli push grey-text">For this project I decided to do a remake of an old assignment where I designed a website prototype for the official Zoom website. I wanted to redo this project because my old version of the site was plain, text heavy, and the colours were very bland and boring, and I knew that I could make it much nicer than the old version.</p>
      <h2 class="kilo push-1-4">Old Version</h2>
      <img class="img-flex push" src="/images/zoom/old.jpg" alt="This is an miage of my previous website concept for Zoom">
      <p class="milli push grey-text">Right off the bat this project was very tricky for me. I had a hard time thinking of how I could effectively improve the site. I wanted to do something that was more innovative than just changing up the colours and images, but still intriguing and eye catching for users. That’s how I came up with the idea of scrolling through a computer screen. I chose to have the website through the visual of a computer screen because I wanted it to be like the act of scrolling through an online app. I wanted the user to be placed into the on-screen visuals and actually be able to interact with and control the main element that was on the home screen—the screen on the desk.</p>
      <h2 class="kilo push-0">Sketches</h2>

      <img class="img-flex push" src="/images/zoom/sketches-2.jpg" alt="This is another image of the sketches that I did for the new illustrations and the new website layout">
      <p class="milli push grey-text">With this project I went through many rounds of sketching trying to figure out how I wanted the illustrations to look. After working on paper for a while with very little luck, I switched to the computer to see if I could think of any that way. I was able to produce some good ideas that I thought fit very well with not only what I was trying to go for, but also Zoom’s overall brand itself.</p>

      <p class="micro push grey-text">These are some of the extra elements that were made during the design process.</p>

      <h2 class="kilo push-0">Challenges</h2>
      <p class="milli push-0 grey-text">My challenge throughout the beginning of this project was I had no idea how I wanted the illustrations to look. It took a lot of experimentation to figure out what to do, but it allowed me to explore quite a few different styles.</p>
