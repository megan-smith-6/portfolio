### [Megan Smith's Portfolio](http://megansmithdesigns.ca/)

I am very passionate about graphic design and visual arts. My strengths are branding, illustration, motion graphics, UI/UX design, and photo editing. But aside from graphic design I have another love—music. I get a lot of my inspiration from music and I believe that a persons music taste can say who they are or how they feel without them even having to speak. Music isn’t much different from graphic design or visual art. I believe that designs should be able to speak for themselves without any explanation. They should have their own voices, styles, and stories. Music and design are both subjective, but telling the story you want to tell and having people understand just by looking... now that's what I strive for!
